To the author nicoco007:  
I really appreciate your hard work! It truly have saved me tons of trouble!  
So I'm translating it into Chinese hoping it can help more people who are not so good at English. :)  
If there is any inconvenience, please feel free to contact me and I'll take it down from the Internet.
